The objective of this script is to provide a short & quick implementation of DynDNS for people who bought a domain on Online/Scaleway websites. Technically, it just calls the Online API to update the DNS with your public IP.

## How to use ?
1. Open the .sh file, and edit the first three lines with your informations
2. Set it executable (chmod is your best friend)
3. Use a crontask to regularly call it.
